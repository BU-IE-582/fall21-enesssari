## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is my [Progress Journal website] (https://bu-ie-582.github.io/fall21-enesssari) created for IE 582 course at Bogazici University.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
